<p>This project used the Python library Django to build and host a website to display projects. This was completed by a group of three students. The formation of the website using Django featured three major components.</p>

<p>The website information was organized in a mySQL database. The database was created according to Python classes created in Django. Each relevant data type - projects, students, professors, & tags - were established as classes with unique attributes. We created an Excel spreadsheet for each class, with a column for each class attribute. For each project, this included various metadata such as each student involved, the associated course & professor, images, and a variety of tags to indicate subject matter. We then used a Python script to run through the spreadsheets and assemble the database inside the Django shell. We then created relations between the information to make the database able to be filtered by class, professor, or student.</p>

<p>Inside Django, we defined the logic to retrieve the correct data from the database for the pages we wanted. We defined three distinct types of pages: one to display lists of students, professors, or courses, one to display projects associated with a student or course, and one to display a detailed view of a single project. Once the correct data was retrieved, it was organized and input into the Django parsing function. The parsing function would insert the data into an HTML template and return the webpage with the correct information.</p>

<p>The templates were regular HTML pages, but with the important feature of having syntax to indicate sections of Python code to the Django parsing function. This allowed the HTML template to have the ability to run through variables from the database and repeat the same form for a variable amount of data.</p>
