<p>As part of a group of six, my group was tasked with designing and building a prototype of a 3D printer for food. Similar products existed commercially, but ranged from the upper hundreds to thousands of dollars. The goal of the project was to design a product on a strict budget of $250, to be accessible for everyday home use or perhaps in a bakery at a larger scale than perviously possible. This task was completed in a single semester, which required long hours and intensive planning and organizational skills.</p> 

<p>The initial planning stages of the project included interviews with fellow students and a couple people in the food industry to understand what they would like and expect from a 3D printer for food. We compiled the responses to develop a comprehensive list of desired features and characteristics of our printer.</p> 

<p>These were translated into engineering specifications working within our time and budget constraints. We divided the function of the printer into different subsystems and determined several design possibilities for each. This included choices such as the style and method of print motion, the placement of the food input, and the choice of controller. We created a total of six complete design concepts and evaluated each by how well they comparatively adhered to the specifications. The outcome was our final design choice.</p> 

<p>In the process of building a working prototype, we developed each subsystem independently to confirm correct function before integration. Another group member and I together developed the electronics of the printer, including the software and hardware.</p> 

<p>We chose to use Marlin, which is an open source program built to run on an Arduino controller which supported all the major features we desired from the software, including easily connecting to a control panel on the printer. However, the Marlin codebase had to be altered to properly control our printer. The specific motors and drivers we chose needed to be calibrated to the software. In addition, our printer used a delta style motion, where the print head moved in 3D space by changing the relative positions of three vertical axes. There were several changes that needed to be made to properly accommodate this, including calibration once the printer was assembled.</p>

<p>The overall function of the electric subsystem was to handle all operations from a CAD file to the printing instructions. Each model file needed to be properly converted into G-Code, which specified the specific print instructions. This was done using Slic3r, which also had to be configured to report the correct G-Code for our printer specifications.</p> 

<p>We found that we could use thickening agents to properly prepare the food so it would print and hold its shape. At the end of the semester, our printer was able to print custom 3D shapes from an SD card with a functioning LCD panel interface to control the printer.</p>
