<p>This project was completed under the guidance of Dr. Michael Cullinan and Dr. Michael Haberman, professors in Mechanical Engineering  at UT Austin. Dr. Cullinan's lab had previously created micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) devices with actuators to control the effective stiffness of the device. These devices were intended to be linked together in an array to create a metamaterial, which acts as a singular material at the macro scale but each linked MEMS component can be controlled individually.</p>

<p>The ability to vary stiffness spatially and temporally can have important uses in acoustics. Our task was to create simulations of these devices in an array to demonstrate the viability of using them for acoustic signal modulation. This included both time-varying as well as as space-varying arrays of MEMS devices. My role in the project was to adapt the design of the device to incorporate electrostatic actuators and characterize the device by its force output and time response.</p>

<p>The improved actuation frequency achieved by using electrostatic actuators instead of the existing thermal actuators would improve the applicability of the devices for acoustic applications. The design I created used comb drives, which have high force output compared to other electrostatic actuator designs. The device incorporated two comb drives on each side for two directional movement, which allowed the device to exhibit both increases in stiffness and negative stiffness.</p>

<p>I conducted simulations to understand the force output capabilities of the device using a combination of ANSYS and Python. Due to the two-axis symmetry of the design, the simulation complexity could be reduced by using a quarter-body of the full device. I used ANSYS  to find the electric field intensity through the device as a result of a voltage input. I then used the exported data from ANSYS and converted the electric field intensity into a force on the actuator using Python.</p>

<p>The device could be modeled as a simple mass-spring-damped system. Therefore, the displacement due to the force and the time response of the movement could be calculated using the natural stiffness of the device and the natural damping present in the system.</p>
