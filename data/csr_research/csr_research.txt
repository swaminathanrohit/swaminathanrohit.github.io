<p>While working at the Center for Space Research, I was given access to data from the GRACE-FO satellites. These two satellites were launched in May 2018 as a joint partnership between NASA and the German Research Centre for Geosciences. They are the second generation of satellites which orbit the earth together and measure with great sensitivity the fluctuations of their relative positions. This gives important data about Earth's gravitational field. Due to the large scale transport of water around the world, data from these satellites offer valuable insight into how water moves - the applications of this include monitoring groundwater and ice caps.</p> 

<p>Accessing the data though a secure shell, I looked at temperature data from three locations on each satellite - the cover, which was exposed, the front end electronics unit, which was inside the cover, and the accelerometer sensor unit, which is in a central, more insulated position. I plotted the data for June, July, and August to identify periods of significant changes and note overall trends.</p>

<p>In the periods with significant changes identified for further examination, I used MATLAB to create a model of the heat transfer between the locations. The model was meant to characterize the stability of the processes. The two primary relationships examined were the cover to the front end electronics unit and the cover to the accelerometer. This would convey how changes in the outside environment are handled inside the spacecraft.</p>

<p>After organizing the data, I used MATLAB to create estimates of the transfer functions of the relationships between the locations. I then analyzed the impulse and frequency response of the transfer functions to understand the impacts of different types of changes. The majority of tests concluded that there was negligible phase change between the locations, amplification of less than 1 dB, and a settling time of under 1 second. This revealed a  stable relationship of heat transfer through the satellite.</p>
